# Rudra.s--Java-Apps

Apps made by Rudra, works everywhere as long as you have a Java 21+ JVM installed in your user-space (find out your CPU, then search the web for "Download JVM 21+ into home directory user-space for [your CPU archutecture] running [your OS]" and replace "[your CPU archutecture]" with your actuall CPU archutecture, and replace "[your OS]" with your actuall OS, then add it to your $PATH or %PATH%)


## P.S., 

If there are any issues, please put them in the "Issues" Tab, also, I have a goal of getting 10+ users using them as a *tool*, so somehow put some comment (for me to know) or backlink (so it can be indexed faster) when you use it and like it!
